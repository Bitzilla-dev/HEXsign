## 🔍 What is HEXsign?
HEXsign is a unique cryptographic identifier generated using a secure hash function derived from the user's **seed phrase**. It provides a **secure verification method** for authorizing smart contract operations. When attached to a request, HEXsign ensures that only authorized users can initiate transactions.

## 🔧 How HEXsign is Generated
HEXsign is created using a **one-way hash function**, ensuring secure identity confirmation without exposing sensitive data.

1️⃣ **User Inputs Seed Phrase**  
   - The seed phrase is entered into a local application or an alternative platform.

2️⃣ **Hashing Algorithm Execution**  
   - A secure hashing function generates a unique HEX key from the seed phrase.

## 🛡️ Security Features
✅ **Irreversible Hashing** – The HEXsign key cannot be reversed to reveal the seed phrase.  
✅ **No Risk to Wallet** – Even if exposed, the HEXsign key does not compromise user funds.  
✅ **Local Generation** – The safest way is using **HEXsign Generator (Windows)** to create the key offline.  
✅ **Unique & Non-Replicable** – Each HEXsign key is unique to a specific wallet address, making forgery impossible.  

## ⚠️ Online Generation Risks
While HEXsign can be generated via a **website** or **Telegram bot**, these methods may introduce **security risks**. Using the **local application** is the most secure approach.

---
📌 **Ensure your seed phrase is never shared. Always generate HEXsign locally for maximum security.**
